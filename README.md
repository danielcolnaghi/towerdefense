# videogame-skel
skeleton for new [videogame](https://github.com/diogoeichert/videogame) projects

please also refer to the [react-skel](https://github.com/RichardMarks/videogame-react-skel) project as an alternative to this

this skeleton provides a sample project with an initial scene, a blue background and a player sprite with the controllable plugin, so you can move it with the keyboard or a gamepad and also the starfield plugin, just to make it cool and provide an introduction to the powerful [plugins](https://github.com/diogoeichert/videogame-plugin) system

it also includes a "loot" object that can be picked up, increasing the score displayed on top and then moving the loot to a different place in the scene

the [code](https://github.com/diogoeichert/videogame-skel/blob/master/index.js) was written with the intention to be as simple as possible, just to introduce the basic features of the library, like creating a scene, adding sprites, collision detection and initializing the engine, with very little configuration

for more complex constructions it is recommended to view the source code for some of the blueprint projects listed in the library repository and also referring to the library docs, specially the API reference
